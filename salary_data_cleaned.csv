Data Scientist,$80K - $161K (Glassdoor est.),"About Us
Camus Energy was founded in 2019 in the San Francisco Bay area. We have deep experience designing and operating distributed systems, and a passion for combating climate change. From pioneering work at Google, SpaceX, and Uber, we bring expertise in massively parallel cloud computing, high-scale real-time analytics, and high-reliability computing.
We work on building software for the grid. The challenges faced by grid operators in an evolving energy landscape are unique. The existing grid is one of humanity's largest machines, and keeping it running safely and smoothly is critical to modern life. But as it becomes smarter, more connected, and more dynamic, we can draw lessons from other industries about how to manage the challenges of scale and reliability for an effective energy transition.
We founded Camus Energy to lend our software engineering skills to address climate change. We are committed to accelerating the adoption of renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions from the energy grid.
We believe that we can combine our desire to impact the world with our technical expertise to bring about positive change. And we are going to have fun doing it.
The Role
You will research and develop solutions to key business questions for Camus and our customers that accelerate our growth and the renewable energy transition. At scale, Camus will have unique access to distribution system data. We will build descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics using the union of our proprietary customer data and environmental data sources. You will learn and apply cutting edge techniques in applied mathematics and statistics, working with energy sector experts at National Labs to put their research into practice. Focus areas will include forecasting, optimization, classification and clustering with an emphasis on the explainability of the results. You can participate in all levels of product development from meeting with the engineers using our products, to the user interface design, and the production architecture and design for the analytic products we develop.
All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regards to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status or any other basis prohibited by law.
