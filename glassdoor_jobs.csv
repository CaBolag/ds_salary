Job Description
The person in this job is responsible for all functions expected of an experienced data scientist in PhysIQ’s research group, namely to develop, advance and validate the analytical technologies of the company; implement, test and deliver production code into the product to generate analytics; implement, test and evaluate competitive and prior art analytics technologies; support statistical analyses of the company’s clinical studies and trials; develop patentable inventions; develop and implement software tools for algorithmic research and clinical statistical analysis; and document analyses, algorithms and related product features. This position is heavily involved in advancing the core analytical capabilities of the company’s products. The mission of the person in this position is to deliver robust analytical methods for productization and to expose and explain phenomena of interest in clinical physiological data.
Responsibilities
Algorithm Development and Testing. This position develops new algorithms or improves existing algorithms for a variety of health assessments, activity and behavior recognition, diagnoses, device performance metrics and any other automated signal processing or machine learning technique that might be used on the company’s human subject data. An example is development of a new index for orthopneic breathing based on physiology telemetry measured by sensors. This responsibility includes testing.
Clinical Data Analysis. This involves analysis of (typically continuous ambulatory) data collected in clinical studies or available from customer de-identified datasets on human subjects accessible to PhysIQ, for any kind of evaluation of results or for any kind of analytics troubleshooting. An example would be analyzing clinical outcomes in a study versus analytical predictions.
Generate Specifications and Deliver Production Analytics. This position writes and delivers production code relating to analytical methods in PhysIQ’s products, primarily in Python language; and writes associated documentation. This position is involved in writing, evaluating, critiquing, meeting about, tracking in online systems and updating product specifications about algorithms and on occasion other functionality in the product.

Deep Sentinel is a breakthrough, next generation home security company that combines state-of-the-art technology (camera, audio, mobile interface, etc.), artificial intelligence and real human guards watching cameras in real-time. No other security company does this. Whereas all other physical security solutions are either reactive (when it is often too late) or require self-monitoring, Deep Sentinel is truly proactive, intervening on potential criminal activity before it happens. Deep Sentinel is literally the only monitored home security system that can (and does!) predict then prevent burglaries before they happen. The Deep Sentinel solution is also easy to install and extremely affordable.

About the Senior Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer
We are seeking an experienced machine learning/data science engineer (5+ years in industry experience) to join our small team in building a truly next-generation home security system utilizing all the killer bells and whistles: deep learning, hybrid-cloud, big data, etc.
The right candidate loves data and revels in powerful insights at every step of the machine learning discovery and deployment process--from model analysis, to model design and optimization to realtime model deployment.
Responsibilities
Develop vision models: We are constantly improving our internal CNN-based models. We use transfer-learning as well as from-scratch training on custom CNN, VGG-like, Inception-like and Resnet-like models.
Develop back-end optimization models: We optimize more than camera ML--we measure and optimize the whole workflow behind the cameras--guard performance, event routing.
Develop novel training techniques: Supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and RL approaches are all part of our toolkit.
Optimizing internal DL infrastructure: Managing internal data pipeline including defining data capture, data stores, training clusters, data QC, model QC, performance optimization.
Measuring/improving models: We keep an ongoing scorecard of the performance of specific models, the parameters (including training specifics) of that model and the various thoughts/insights from that round of training.
Minimum Qualifications
Data Science GSD (GET STUFF DONE!): Data science is first and foremost about getting it done--doing the right thing be it data movement, data cleansing, modeling or optimizing.
Machine Learning Experience (5+ years total, 2+ years at a commercial enterprise for a production product): This is not an entry-level position for new grads or recent-graduate level students. Whether it’s for search or for NLP or bayes networks or recommender systems, commercial experience with ML-driven systems is a requirement.
Experience with massive data sets (10+ TB, image data sets preferred): Experience working with and managing multi-terabyte-dataset sizes is important: Filesystem organization, data pipelines, etcl.
The Start-Up mentality: The right candidate considers herself/himself to be a “get-’er-done” type of person and is looking to have a huge impact at a small company. Hard work is a must, so the right person exudes positive life-giving energy from solving hard problems, working hands-on and doing things other people consider impossible. We’re going to keep the team super small for the time being (lean startup mode FTW) so you’ve gotta be willing to roll up your sleeves and do everything from writing code to helping out with product and software QA. (PS Good news–the whole team will be like this too, and that’s the best type of team to be on.)
